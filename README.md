# Sieve Of Eratosthenes Multithreaded
Very fast 64 bit Multithreaded Sieve of Eratosthenes Prime Number Generator, written in C++. <br>
(You can calculate Primes up to 18.446.744.069.414.584.318, if you have enough RAM installed -> ~ 16 Exbibytes)

Source code with a compiled Windows x64 EXE included.

Have fun!

Todo:
1. Code cleanup

2. AVX2 registers
3. Reducing memory footprint
4. Different code for multithreaded Sieve
<br>
<br>
The implementation was fast and easy and fit very good.
<br>
But i think there's much more performance possible.
