# Sieve Of Eratosthenes Multithreaded
Very fast Multithreaded Sieve of Eratosthenes Prime Number Generator, written in C++.

Source code with a compiled Windows x64 (AVX2) EXE included.

Have fun!

Todo:
1. Code cleanup
2. Adding calculation in AVX2 registers (maybe integrate Agner Fog's Vector Class Library)
3. A boolean is 8 bit in memory (standard array). Vector with booleans could be used or writing an alternative array with 1 bit per boolean
   (but this could slow down the algo a little bit.)
