# Sieve Of Eratosthenes Multithreaded
Very fast Multithreaded Sieve of Eratosthenes Prime Number Generator, written in C++.

Source code with a compiled Windows x64 (AVX2) Platform EXE included.

Have fun!

!;)

Todo:
1. Code cleanup
2. adding use of AVX2 registers (maybe integrate Agner Fog's Vector Class Library)
