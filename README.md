# Sieve Of Eratosthenes Multithreaded
Very fast Multithreaded Sieve of Eratosthenes Prime Number Generator, written in C++.

Source code with a compiled Windows x64 (AVX2) Platform EXE included.

Have fun!

!;)

Todo:
1. Code cleanup
2. adding use of AVX2 registers (maybe integrate Agner Fog's Vector Class Library)


Processor: Intel i9-9940X - 14 Cores / 28 Threads - 3.3 Ghz - Turbo-Mode: off
