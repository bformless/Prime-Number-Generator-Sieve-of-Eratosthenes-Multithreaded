# Sieve Of Eratosthenes Multithreaded
Very fast Multithreaded Sieve of Eratosthenes Prime Number Generator, written in C++.

Source code with a compiled Windows x64 (AVX2) EXE included.

Have fun!

Todo:
1. Code cleanup

2. Use of AVX2 registers (Agner Fog's Vector Class Library) - 
   I have tested it, but it is slightly slower.

3. A boolean is 8 bit in memory (standard array).
   A 1 bit array to save memory. (vector boolean or boost bitset)
